# CUDA Program 

This repository contains my training programs and experiments in **Accelerated Computing with CUDA**.  
The goal is to build hands-on experience with **parallel programming**, **GPU computing**, and performance optimization.

---

##  Repository Structure
- `demo.ipynb` → First CUDA program (basic setup)
- Future files will include CUDA kernels, memory management, and performance test programs.

---

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **CUDA Toolkit**
- **NVIDIA GPU (CUDA-capable)**
- **Linux ubuntu (development environment)**

---

##  Objectives
- Learn the fundamentals of GPU programming with CUDA
- Practice writing and optimizing CUDA kernels
- Explore concepts like:
  - Thread hierarchy (grids, blocks, warps)
  - Shared vs global memory
  - Streams and concurrency

---

##  How to Build & Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SARPAT/cuda_program.git
   cd cuda_program
